# Fraud Detection System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **Fraud Detection System** designed to identify fraudulent transactions in **social security benefits payments** using **machine learning models**. The system applies **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms** to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
 
Key features of the project:
- **Synthetic fraud dataset** creation
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering** (time-based, geographic, and transaction-based)
- **Data Balancing** using **SMOTE**
- **Multiple Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV
- **Model saving and deployment**
